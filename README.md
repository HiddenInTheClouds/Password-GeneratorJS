## Description

This repo contains code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows a user to generate a random password from 8 to 128 characters. These characters include: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
This was created with the intetion of learning Javascript and using the basics of JS to create a simple application. This application allows a user to have a safe and unique randomly generated password.

The steps required to install the application would be adding the JavaScript into the HTML right before the body element is closed.
